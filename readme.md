## Dwitter - Data for Twitter

This repository is a placeholder for a twitter crawler that can be used to crawl "public" data from Twitter.  On completion, this will be integrated into a distributed crawling infrastructure. The project aims to build an API interface which can be retrofitted in place of the Twitter official API implementation.

## When will work start on this?
Active development will start if this repository 100 Stars or gets sponsored whichever comes first.

## Why build it?
The recent news about [Twitter API's new pricing](https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/29/twitter-announces-new-api-with-only-free-basic-and-enterprise-levels/) means there will be quite a few use cases that fall between the $100 and $42K plans. This repository is aimed at serving these users.
